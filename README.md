# ABAP_for_Notepad++

The following XML file is a UDL(User Defined Language) for ABAP in Notepad++.
Importing this file would make Notepad++ identify all the ABAP keywords.

There are already many UDLs available for ABAP. This UDL includes the following features apart from already available ones:

	• Modern ABAP key words.
	• RAP(Restful ABAP Programming) keywords.
	• Missing key words in existing UDLs.

# Steps to import:
	1) Go to the Menu. Choose Language->User Defined Language->Define your Language.
	2) In the "User Defined Language" dialog, click on "Import…".
	3) Import the downloaded "abap.xml" file.
	4) Now you should see a pop up that "Import is successful".
	5) Restart Notepad++. (Sometimes, it might be required). Go to the menu Language and you should be able to see "ABAP" as an option to choose.

Couldn't find original authors who contributed to the base UDL.

# Contribution:
I see there are many more key words which are still missing. Feel free to contribute by  creating a new pull request to and keep the UDL updated.
